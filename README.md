# DNA-RNA_Project

## Table of content 

This repository contains the final project of Group 5 for the DNA/RNA Dynamics course (MSc in Bioinformatics, University of Bologna, a.y. 2024/2025). It features a complete pipeline for analyzing Illumina 450K methylation data using R. The pipeline includes preprocessing (with the preprocessNoob method), quality control, normalization, statistical analysis (using  Mann-Whitney U test and P-value threshold of 0.05), principal component analysis (PCA), and the identification of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between control (CTRL) and disease (DIS) samples.
