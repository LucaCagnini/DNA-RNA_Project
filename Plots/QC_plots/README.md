-QC_plot: Raw signal intensity across samples before normalization. Used to detect outliers and technical variation.

-density_beta_and_m_values: Iensity distribution of Beta and M-values for CTRL vs DIS groups. Shows methylation pattern differences.

-negative_controls: Negative control probes to assess background signal and potential technical issues.

-plot_type1_type2: Comparison of raw and Noob-normalized Beta-values. Normalization reduces probe type bias and variance across samples.
